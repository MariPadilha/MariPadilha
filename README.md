#### Jarvas is my latest project, designed as a versatile and intelligent system aimed at improving the efficiency of task management and automation. It incorporates cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless user experience and is currently being used as a study tool by masterâ€™s students in a university course.
   
Key features include:

>- Task Automation: Jarvas simplifies complex workflows, enabling users to automate repetitive tasks.
>- Intelligent Assistance: The system uses algorithms to provide smart recommendations and optimise decision-making.
>- Scalability: Built to handle various use cases, from small teams to large organisations.
>- Security: Robust implementation of OAuth2 and JWT authentication ensures that user data is protected.
>- Jarvas is a work in progress, and Iâ€™m constantly adding new features and optimising it for real-world applications. Itâ€™s a project that reflects my passion >- for automation, cloud technologies, and security.
